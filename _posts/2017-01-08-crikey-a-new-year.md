title: Crikey A New Year
---

How hopeless!  My last post was nearly a year ago - so much for a new year resolution to blog regularly.

I'll try to catch up by listing the things I have been up to.

1. Python/Flask web dashboard converted to Bootstrap and new stuff added.
1. Node app using EIP routing patterns to take raw sightings data when a user is
detected and enriched through a series of transformations and filters to display
pretty images of sighted users and their known demographic data.
