title: Fix Yarn Upgrade Brew Issue
tags: yarn mac

I recently needed to upgrade Yarn and Brew told me to run `brew yarn upgrade` however that failed in the past so I moved on.  Today though I decided to fix the issue.  A `brew update` on my newly upgrade High Sierra mac left me with

``` terminal
  $ brew update
  xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
  Updated 1 tap (homebrew/core).
  ==> New Formulae
  ...

```

I don't use XCode though I appreciate the command line tools and dependencies and happily enough [someone else went through this pain](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209624/how-to-fix-homebrew-error-invalid-active-developer-path-after-upgrade-to-os-x).

The trick

``` terminal
  $ sudo xcode-select --install
  $ sudo xcode-select -switch /
```

Then do a `brew update` which probably won't be required followed by the yarn upgrade.

``` terminal
  $ brew upgrade yarn

  ==> Caveats
  This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
  because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

  If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

  For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
      LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib
      CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include
  For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig
