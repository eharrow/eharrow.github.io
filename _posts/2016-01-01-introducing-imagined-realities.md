title: Introducing Imagined Realities
---

First day of a new year which deserves a new resolution to document who, what, how, where and when so that I have a reference.

The first thing to note is that this site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github](http://github.com) pages.  I am using Jekyll running under Vagrant with the source synced with my Mac as I don't really want to install all the cruft when I use Vagrant and have an Ubuntu instance for dev purposes.  Running <code>Jekyll server</code> allows me to test the content before pushing the source (not the generated site) upto Github.
